<h2><em>INSTRUCTIONS</em></h2>
<p style="border:black 2px solid">
firstly, prepare the whipped cream by using hand blender / whisk or mixer.<br>
pour 2 cups of thickened cream or 35% milk fat into a blender.<br>
further, blend for 40-50 seconds till the cream turns light and fluffy. do not over blend, as they turn to butter.
transfer the prepared whipped cream to a large mixing bowl.<br>
furthermore, pour 1 cup of condensed milk. make sure the condensed milk is cold or refrigerate for atleast 30 minutes.
also add 1 tsp of vanilla extract or any flavours of your choice. to prepare chocolate ice cream, use coco powder.
now fold gently without breaking the air incorporated into whipped cream.
further, transfer the mixture into a airtight container.<br>
make sure to cover the box and freeze for atleast 5 hours or till they set completely.
now take a scooper and scoop up the vanilla ice cream onto a waffle cones. make sure to wet your scooper in hot water before scooping. this helps to scoop ice cream easily.
finally, garnish with few coco chips or choco syrup before serving.<br>
